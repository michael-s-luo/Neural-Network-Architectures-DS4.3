# Data Science @ BloomTech - Unit 4
## 4.3: Neural Network Architectures & Deep Learning

This repository serves to store and document my completed projects, assignments, and learning materials from the BloomTech Data Science curriculum. Unit 4.2 focuses on models beyond a simple Feed Foward Neural Network into the territory of "deep learning" and is composed of the following

### 1: Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
  * Major Topics: 


### 2: Convolutional Neural Networks
  * Major Topics: 


### 3: AutoEncoders and Generative Models
  * Major Topics: 



Module Projects, Relevant Datasets, Guided Projects, and Warm-up activities for this unit are located in each module's respective folder.
